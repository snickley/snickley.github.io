        What is Neuroplasticity?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The concept of a malleable brain - what we give our sustained focus to is what we will remember / get good at. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3"> How does the understanding of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
      <p>
        It means that we're in control of our learning, our emotional states, and our skill levels for any particular thing. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3"> How could you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit? </h3>
      <p>
        Be intentional about what you give your time and attention. Maintain awareness that you're building your brain on a daily basis, and think about what you want to have the strongest pathways for. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </h3>
      <p>
        Learn a language, learn a new skill, regular mild to moderate exercise, challenging brain-game puzzles. Anything that encourages mastery or builds new connections.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">What is Growth Mindset and why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        The mindset that, given what we know about neuroplasticity, anything is possible to learn. If you give something enough time and attention, slowly building your understanding / skill, you will get good at it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">Did anything surprise or change for you, in this exploration?</h3>
      <p>
        Not really - I've been a big fan of metacognition and the concept of a growth mindset since my early 20s. I remember learning about it during training for my first 'real' job and being blown away. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I already have - but it's about bringing your thoughts back to "this is hard, but I can do hard things" whenever a task gets complicated. This was my mantra during labour!
