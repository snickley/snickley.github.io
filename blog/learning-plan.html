        Long-term goal or career pathway
      </h3>
      <p>
        To work flexibly as a web developer; whether that's for an organisation or for myself I'm currently undecided. At this stage I don't have ambitions to get into leadership pathways.

        Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        My greatest strengths for learning are a growth mindset, and a psychological understanding of how learning works. I spent ~4 years studying educational psychology and so I've already delved quite deeply into what motivates me as a learner. My biggest limitation is my lack of focus; I'm easily distracted by new interests, and I tend to adopt them quite passionately. I know that the way to manage this from a learning/career perspective it to keep myself challenged with the tasks I'm working on.

        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'd like to develop my rhythms of working and time management, as well as managing difficult conversations. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-h3">
        Commitment for workload management:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've committed a regular working week to Dev Academy tasks, as well as arranged for childcare in the evenings when I need to do additional catch-up work. I'm used to working alone so I'll schedule times to catch up with what's happening in Discord.
        <br><br> 
        When things are building up and starting to get to me, I'll take a step back to plan and ask for help.

      <h3 class="blog-h3">
        How and where I will seek help in a timely way:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Once I've spent more than an hour researching a solution, I'll ask for help in the appropriate "questions" channel, or directly to my facilitator.
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-h3">
        What I expect from the Facilitation team:
      </h3>     
      <p>
        Direction. Facilitators are there to guide you in your learning, not provide answers. 
      </p> 

      <h3 class="blog-h3">
        Block-out times:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will do dinner time with my son every night, and bedtime where I can fit it in. Dinner time is typically 5pm-6pm, and bedtime is wrapped up by 9pm at the latest. 
      </p>

      Not much has actually changed here! The main thing is just that I'm revising how long I'll give myself to research a problem before asking for help.

        My best effort. Taking care of myself with breaks, good food and regular movement. Comparing my progress to my prior skill level. Building the skill of asking for help before I get frustrated. Kindness and empathy toward others.
