        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The ethical decision I faced was between my instinct to keep my son, Henry, safe during the pandemic, versus maintaining family relationships. My sister has chosen not to vaccinate her family; her two children are old enough to be vaccinated but not old enough to decide for themselves whether they should be. Henry is still too young to be vaccinated. 
      </br>
        On one hand: Henry adores his aunty, uncle and cousins, and limiting their contact would hurt their relationship. He's unlikely to have other cousins or siblings, so they're his only chance for family relationships close in age. 
      </br>
        On the other hand: we still don't know enough about what causes long-term effects from covid, and risking his health makes me feel like an awful parent. The risks are real, although they feel remote at times. 
      </br>
        How I weighed it up: We're all likely to get covid at some point; sacrificing relationships for a small increase in risk to catch it sooner felt wrong. A support network is also crucial for long-term health and cutting off my sister would not help on that front. 
      </br>
        The consequences: I still feel uneasy whenever we're together, but I still think it's the right decision in current circumstances. Henry still has a great relationship with his cousins, and so far, has not had covid.

        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Being part of the hegemonic culture in Aotearoa often feels like a lack of culture. I grew up in Te Tai Tokerau, so I had a lot of exposure to Māori culture - but it was always separate from me and the way I was being raised. I've also not spent any time overseas, so it's difficult compare the hegemonic NZ culture vs that of other Western countries. What I have noticed from discussions with international friends is a couple of things that surprise them but seem normal to me: 
        <ul>
          <li>Willingness to try new things and fail.</li>
          <li>Contrasted with strong importance on family connections / obligations.</li>
          <li>Casual nature of interactions, especially with those of higher position in a work context.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This means that I respect expertise over hierarchy, and I believe that everyone has the ability to further their learning in areas of interest and contributes in their own way. I don't place a lot of importance on traditional (capitalist) measures of success.

        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The lack of respect for hierarchy has been both a strength and limitation in my career, coming down to the environment and whether it is valued by those I'm working with. In flexible environments this has been an advantage because I don't have any hesitation about sharing my thoughts on a solution based on who has suggested it. In more hierarchical environments I worked in earlier in my career this was seen as less desirable.
      </br>
        I live by the saying “if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room” which reflects my desire for constant growth and learning. This has mostly been a strength; however, I always need to be aware of getting too comfortable with my job; I've noticed that when I move too far into comfortable territory my productivity starts to drop. 
      </p>

        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
      </h3>    
      <p>
        My greatest strength for learning is a growth mindset; I truly believe that everyone can learn how to do something they're interested enough in. My degree was in education (psychology of, not teaching) and one of my biggest takeaways from that whole period of my life is the importance of self-efficacy; if you believe you can do something, you're far more likely to achieve it. If you believe you can't then you put in less effort and have lower chances of achieving it.  
      </br>
        My biggest learning obstacle is lack of focus. I'm still waiting to be assessed but suspect I may have inatentive ADHD. I know from experience that maintaining interest is crucial for my success; if I get bored my focus and therefore output drops no matter how hard I try to stay on task.

        Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>    
      <p>
        I've been the only person doing my job at my company for roughly 5 years now, so this is a distant memory, I'm afraid! 
      </br>
        The last time I worked with a team there was one person who had noticeably lower output, and lower quality to what he did produce. At one point it was only the two of us in the team, and I was doing 70% of the work while he did 30%, but so poorly that I still needed to review everything he did.
      </br>
        My strategy at the time in trying to work productively together was to give him all the easy stuff and work extra hard myself to do everything else, because I recognised that he was struggling with some personal stuff. 
      </br>
        This was not an effective strategy, I ended up burnt out, and our manager didn't even know that it was happening - we were both given permanent positions, but he was not suited for the tasks. 
      </br>
        In future I'd escalate the situation sooner to make sure that my colleague was getting the support they needed from the right directions. It would have been a better outcome for this colleague if he was supported in finding a more appropriate role before taking the permanent position.
