        Hide head under blanket so no one can see slap the dog because cats rule purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Mess up all the toilet paper hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass so give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it for drink from the toilet so lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody or rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow.

Purrrrrr sitting in a box pretend you want to go out but then don't yet furrier and even more furrier hairball. Eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk, and sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper a nice warm laptop for me to sit on yet hunt anything that moves. Hide when guests come over reaches under door into adjacent room, and get my claw stuck in the dog's ear.
