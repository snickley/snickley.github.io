        What is emotional intelligence?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <em>The ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where IQ measures someone's ability to grasp or communicate complex ideas and logically solve problems, EQ is all about using your awareness of your own and others' emotional states to guide decisions. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3"> Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        A growing body of evidence suggests that EQ is more important than IQ in predicting success in life, and particularly at work. The ability to understand and react appropriately your own and others' emotions during times of stress or other challenging states makes for a great leader, parent, partner or friend.
