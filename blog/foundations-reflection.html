        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm pretty good at this mindset stuff, but it's always good to recentre.</li>
          <li>My focus is worse than I thought. #1 to work-on, for me.</li>
          <li>I need to ask for help more quickly. My internal voice about how long I should struggle before I 'bother' someone else needs work.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        Understanding yourself and your motivations for doing anything is useful, especially when the going gets tough. It helps to think about your 'why' to keep your motivation up. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        My degree is in educational pyschology. I know this stuff. What surprised me the most was that I'd never thought to apply <em>that</em> learning to my attempts at learning to code. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I haven't really found any of it difficult, so far. Introspection isn't new for me... but 'most challenging' I suppose, is writing about it. Blog posts take me a long time. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        It's in the name - "human skills". Most developers need to work on a team, so being able to relate to your coworkers is crucial. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        No, I think it's always valuable to be reminded of these things... but personally I haven't felt too challenged by the core material yet as it aligns more closely with my background than the tech material. So I've definitely felt so far that I could have used more time on the tech stuff.
