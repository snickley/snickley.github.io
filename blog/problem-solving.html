      <h3 class="blog-h3">Blocked on a simple problem; what was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        Syntax errors! There have been many - the most recent one was using "=" instead of "=="
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        Took a break, rethought what I was trying to do, re-read my code. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Frustrated! But I also know that syntax errors are a normal part of code even when you've been doing it a long time. It doesn't make me feel like it's too hard, or that I can't learn it. I'm just a bit annoyed at the time because I know it's staring me in the face and I can't see it. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        My brain needs more time to build the pathways on syntax - practice, practice, practice!!
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-h3">Elegantly solved a problem: what was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        Ah I don't know if I'd call it elegant, but I got there in the end... with deBee I thought I could do it one way, then the solution didn't work for the second test. I spent a little while looking for different ways to do it so that I could keep my initial way of doing it, then finally accepted that I needed a different approach. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        Googling. Lots of google. I did go to ask for help in discord but saw others had already been there and managed to solve it from following along with their questions. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Challenged but in a good way. With the syntax part above it was annoying, but in figuring out how to solve the problem it was enjoyable even when I figured out I needed to remove the part that was working. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="blog-h3">What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        Hmm. I think my learnings from this week are mostly that I'm doing better than I thought I was, with the mindset stuff. I still have a million miles to go with the technical side, but that's a challenge rather than a problem. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-h3">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode - 3/5; this will come with time I think, as I understand more about what processes I need to work through. 
        <br><br>
        Trying something - 4/5; Once I've started, trying different things is easy. 'Trying something' as a first step is a bit more difficult for me.
        <br><br>
        Rubber ducky method - 5/5; I'm fine with talking to inanimate objects. It doesn't always work for me, but I don't feel uncomfortable about it at all. 
        <br><br>
        Reading error messages - 3/5; expect this will also come with time!
        <br><br>
        Console.logging - 3/5; I like this a lot in theory but I'm not always confident what I should be console.logging so I end up just logging everything until I get the thing I was looking for... but I guess that's sort of the point?
        <br><br>
        Googling - 4/5; google has been my only support in my job for a long time so I'm very confident with it - just less confident with the language to use for these newer problems to find the result I need.
        <br><br>
        Asking your peers for help - 4/5; confident, just unfamiliar. I forget about this avenue sometimes.
        <br><br>
        Asking coaches for help  - 4/5; same as peers. I don't have any aversion to asking for help from people, I just tend to default more to the other methods. 
        <br><br>
        Improving your process with reflection - 3/5; something I need to spend more time on. I've been conditioned to get something working and move on, but I know there's a lot to be learned from refactoring and/or looking at other ways to do the same thing.
